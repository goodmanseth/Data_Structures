## Synopsis

This is my implementation of several data structures, written in Java. My end goal is to create general classes to be used with multiple data input types.

## Motivation

I'm currently in the process of self-teaching Java. After working extensively with C for over a year, I decided it would be helpful and useful to write these structures in Java, both to further my understanding in Java and in the structures themselves.
